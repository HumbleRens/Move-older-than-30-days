Script sets a source folder and a destination folder, and then retrieves a list of files from the source folder that were last modified more than 30 days ago. Then it loops through the list of files and moves them to the destination folder.

Change source and destination folders to the appropriate locations:
-\\Server1\SharedFolder,\\Server2\ArchiveFolder

To change the desired number, edit the number: (-30)
